Factory Design Pattern

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub0DXaeV6hA

WHAT ?

- The factory object returns one of several classes that share a super class
- The Class is chosen at run time

WHEN ?

- You don't know ahead of time what class object you need
- When all of the potential classes have the same super class
- To centralize class selection code
- You don't want the user o have to know every subclass
- To encapsulate object creation
